- Reviewed `courses/gcap3056/ProjectMetaDirector/searchExpectations.md` and ProjectMetaDirector/process.log for format and expectations.
- Attempted automated reachability checks for core sources (HKFSD, RTHK, info.gov.hk, HK01, SCMP). HKFSD, RTHK, info.gov.hk and HK01 responded; SCMP returned 403.
- Note: The environment's terminal/network tooling produced a filesystem/provider error when attempting full page fetches; live scraping did not complete in this session.
- Action taken: Created `reportMediaCoverage.md` (template + search plan) at `courses/gcap3056/group4-fire-service-2/reportMediaCoverage.md` so the team can fill verified article metadata when network access is available.

Next steps:
- Run the recommended `curl`/site-search commands to gather article titles, dates and URLs, then populate `reportMediaCoverage.md` with 5–8 verified items.
- If you want me to re-run the live fetches, grant permission or run the example commands locally and paste outputs here; I will integrate them.
